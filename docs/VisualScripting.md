### Integration Guidelines

#### Using the Debug System
1. Initialize the debug manager
```typescript
const debugManager = DebugManager.getInstance();
```

2. Set up breakpoints
```typescript
debugManager.breakpoints.addBreakpoint(nodeId);
// or with condition
debugManager.breakpoints.addConditionalBreakpoint(nodeId, "value > 10");
```

3. Monitor variables
```typescript
debugManager.variableWatcher.watchVariable(variableId);
```

4. Add debug listeners
```typescript
debugManager.addListener((event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'nodeEnter':
      console.log(`Entering node: ${event.node.title}`);
      break;
    case 'variableChanged':
      console.log(`Variable ${event.variableId} changed to ${event.newValue}`);
      break;
  }
});
```

5. Control execution
```typescript
// Enable step-by-step mode
debugManager.enableStepByStep();

// Take a single step
debugManager.step();

// Resume execution
debugManager.resume();
```

### Best Practices
- Use conditional breakpoints for complex debugging scenarios
- Monitor critical variables for state changes
- Analyze performance metrics regularly
- Keep watch lists focused on relevant variables
- Clear breakpoints and watches when debugging session ends
- Use step-by-step execution for complex logic flows
- Review call stack statistics for optimization opportunities

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize the number of active breakpoints
- Use conditional breakpoints judiciously
- Clear variable history periodically
- Monitor memory usage during long debug sessions
- Consider disabling debug features in production builds
