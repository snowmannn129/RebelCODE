# Scene Editor

## Overview
The Scene Editor is a fundamental tool in the game engine that provides a visual interface for creating, manipulating, and organizing game scenes. It allows developers and designers to place objects, set up lighting, configure components, and preview their scenes in real-time.

## Core Features

### Scene Hierarchy Management
- Tree-based view of all scene objects and their relationships
- Drag-and-drop functionality for object parenting
- Quick search and filtering of scene objects
- Support for prefab instances and variants

### Object Manipulation Tools
- Translation, rotation, and scale gizmos
- World/Local space transformation modes
- Snapping and grid alignment options
- Multi-object editing capabilities
- Pivot point manipulation

### Component Management
- Visual component inspector
- Real-time component property editing
- Component addition/removal interface
- Custom component visualization support
- Undo/Redo functionality for all operations

### Scene Navigation
- Multiple viewport layouts (perspective, orthographic views)
- Camera bookmarks and saved viewports
- Scene view customization options
- Focus and frame selected objects
- Navigation gizmo for quick orientation

### Scene Organization
- Layer system for object categorization
- Scene sections for large-scale organization
- View filters for different object types
- Custom tags and search functionality
- Scene templates and presets

## Technical Implementation

### Scene Data Structure
```cpp
class SceneEditor {
private:
    struct SceneNode {
        Transform transform;
        std::vector<Component*> components;
        std::vector<SceneNode*> children;
        SceneNode* parent;
    };
    
    SceneNode* rootNode;
    std::unordered_map<UUID, SceneNode*> nodeRegistry;
};
```

### Viewport Rendering
```cpp
class ViewportRenderer {
public:
    void RenderScene(const SceneData& scene);
    void UpdateGizmos(const EditorContext& context);
    void HandleSelection(const Ray& mouseRay);
    
private:
    Camera editorCamera;
    RenderPipeline pipeline;
    GizmoManager gizmoSystem;
};
```

### Selection System
```cpp
class SelectionManager {
public:
    void SelectObject(UUID objectId);
    void MultiSelect(const std::vector<UUID>& objectIds);
    void ClearSelection();
    
private:
    std::set<UUID> selectedObjects;
    TransformGizmo activeGizmo;
};
```

## Integration Points

### With Engine Core
- Direct access to scene graph and entity component system
- Real-time updates to physics and rendering systems
- Integration with the asset management system
- Support for engine-wide undo/redo operations

### With Other Tools
- Material editor integration for object materials
- Terrain editor for landscape manipulation
- Animation editor for preview and setup
- Asset browser for quick access to resources
- Blueprint editor for visual scripting

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Techniques
- Efficient scene tree traversal algorithms
- Viewport culling for large scenes
- Lazy loading of scene sections
- Asynchronous property updates
- Optimized gizmo rendering

### Memory Management
- Smart pointer usage for scene objects
- Resource pooling for commonly used components
- Efficient scene serialization
- Memory-mapped scene loading for large scenes

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Advanced scene composition tools
- Real-time global illumination preview
- Collaborative editing capabilities
- Version control integration
- Advanced scene comparison tools

### Extensibility
- Plugin system for custom editor tools
- Scripting API for editor automation
- Custom viewport shaders
- Extended gizmo system
- Custom property editors

## Best Practices

### Scene Organization
- Maintain clear hierarchy structure
- Use meaningful object names
- Implement proper scene segmentation
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Utilize layers and tags effectively

### Performance Guidelines
- Limit scene depth for better performance
- Optimize large scene handling
- Use instancing for repeated objects
- Implement proper LOD setup
- Monitor memory usage

## Error Handling

### Recovery Systems
- Auto-save functionality
- Crash recovery system
- Scene validation checks
- Corrupt scene recovery tools
- Backup management system

### Validation
- Scene integrity checks
- Reference validation
- Component dependency verification
- Asset dependency tracking
- Scene optimization suggestions
