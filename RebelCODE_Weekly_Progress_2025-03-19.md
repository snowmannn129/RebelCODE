# RebelCODE Weekly Progress Report

## Week of March 13, 2025 - March 19, 2025

### Summary
This week marked significant progress in establishing the core framework for RebelCODE and beginning the Monaco editor integration. The team focused on building the foundation for the project management system, file system integration, and UI workspace layout. We've made good progress on the Monaco editor integration with initial syntax highlighting for TypeScript/JavaScript. Challenges were encountered with the AI integration architecture planning, but research is ongoing to identify the best approach for code completion and error detection.

### Key Achievements
1. Established core framework architecture design
2. Integrated basic Monaco editor with syntax highlighting
3. Implemented initial TypeScript/JavaScript language support
4. Created basic UI workspace layout and panel system
5. Started breakpoint management for debugging tools
6. Began AI integration architecture design
7. Created comprehensive tracking documents (Feature Checklist, Final Goal Tracking, Completion Roadmap)
8. Designed Sprint 1 task assignments with clear responsibilities and deadlines

### Challenges & Solutions
1. **Monaco Editor Customization**: The team encountered challenges with customizing Monaco editor features. Solution: Created a more modular approach to editor extensions and leveraged existing documentation and examples.
2. **AI Integration Complexity**: Determining the best approach for AI code completion integration proved challenging. Solution: Researching existing implementations and planning a phased approach starting with basic functionality.
3. **Cross-Component Dependencies**: Managing dependencies between components (e.g., editor, language support, debugging). Solution: Established clear interfaces between components and implemented a more decoupled architecture.

### Next Week's Focus
1. Complete core framework architecture implementation
2. Finalize Monaco editor base integration
3. Enhance TypeScript/JavaScript language support
4. Implement workspace layout and panel system
5. Progress on breakpoint management implementation
6. Finalize AI integration architecture design
7. Set up unit testing framework
8. Establish continuous integration pipeline

### Resource Allocation
- **Michael Chen**: Focusing on core framework architecture and error handling
- **Sarah Johnson**: Dedicated to Monaco editor integration and UI components
- **David Rodriguez**: Working on file system integration and project management
- **Emily Kim**: Concentrating on language support and syntax highlighting
- **James Wilson**: Researching AI integration and code completion
- **Olivia Martinez**: Setting up testing framework and quality assurance
- **Daniel Lee**: Implementing continuous integration and build system

### Risk Updates
- **New Risk**: Monaco editor customization may require more effort than anticipated. Mitigation: Allocate additional resources and research existing solutions.
- **Increased Risk**: AI feature integration complexity may impact timeline. Mitigation: Consider phased implementation with incremental functionality.
- **Decreased Risk**: Core framework architecture design is progressing well, reducing overall project structure risk.

### Notes & Action Items
- Schedule technical design meeting for Monaco editor customization
- Create development environment setup documentation
- Finalize Sprint 1 task assignments
- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Establish code review guidelines and process

### Technical Debt Management

- Noted potential issues with Monaco editor extensions that may need redesign
- Planning to address language-specific code duplication in future sprints
- Documenting areas with test coverage gaps for prioritized implementation

### Performance Metrics
- Editor responsiveness: Initial measurements showing ~70ms (target: <50ms)
- Code completion response time: ~300ms (target: <200ms)
- Memory usage: ~400MB during development (within target range)
- CPU usage: 15-20% during normal operation (within target range)
- Startup time: ~4 seconds (target: <3 seconds)
- File indexing speed: Not yet measured
- Search performance: Not yet measured
